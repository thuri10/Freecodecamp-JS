/*
Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable
Both Chrome and Firefox have excellent JavaScript consoles, also known as DevTools, for debugging your JavaScript.

You can find Developer tools in your Chrome's menu or Web Console in Firefox's menu. If you're using a different browser, or a mobile phone, we strongly recommend switching to desktop Firefox or Chrome.

Use the console.log() method to print the value of the variable a where noted in the code.

let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Only change code below this
console.log(a);

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);
