## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Freecodecamp

This is a repository for putting solutions of various Freecodecamp Data stuctures and Algorithm Solutions.

Topics covered throughout the course include

### Basic JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

### ES6

ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.

Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.

ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.

### Regular Expressions

Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches.

In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.

### Debugging

Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.

Issues in code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.

In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen.

### Basic Data Structures

Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript data structures — arrays and objects.

In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to use in different situations. You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access and manipulate data.

- [x] Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data
- [x] Access an Array's Contents Using Bracket Notation

- [x] Use the delete Keyword to Remove Object Properties
- [x] Check if an Object has a Property
- [ ] Iterate Through the Keys of an Object with a for...in Statement
- [x] Generate an Array of All Object Keys with Object.keys()
- [x] Modify an Array Stored in an Object

### Basic Algorithm Scripting

An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.

To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.

- [x] Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
- [x] Reverse a String
- [x]  Factorialize a Number
- [x] Find the Longest Word in a String
- [x] Return Largest Numbers in Arrays
- [ ] Confirm the Ending
- [x] Repeat a String Repeat a String
- [x] Truncate a String
- [x] Finders Keepers
- [x] Boo who
- [x] Title Case a Sentence
- [ ] Slice and Splice
- [ ] Falsy Bouncer
- [x] Where do I Belong
- [ ] Mutations
- [ ] Chunky Monkey

### Object Oriented Programming

OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, objects and classes organize code to describe things and what they can do.

In this course, you'll learn the basic principles of OOP in JavaScript, including the this keyword, prototype chains, constructors, and inheritance.

- [ ] Create a Basic JavaScript Object
- [ ] Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object
- [ ] Create a Method on an Object
- [ ] Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword
- [ ] Define a Constructor Function
- [ ] Use a Constructor to Create Objects
- [ ] Extend Constructors to Receive Arguments
- [ ] Verify an Object's Constructor with instanceof
- [ ] Understand Own Properties
- [ ] Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code
- [ ] Iterate Over All Properties
- [ ] Understand the Constructor Property
- [ ] Change the Prototype to a New Object
- [ ] Remember to Set the Constructor Property when Changing the Prototype
- [ ] Understand Where an Object’s Prototype Comes From
- [ ] Understand the Prototype Chain
- [ ] Use Inheritance So You Don't Repeat Yourself
- [ ] Inherit Behaviors from a Supertype
- [ ] Set the Child's Prototype to an Instance of the Parent
- [ ] Reset an Inherited Constructor Property
- [ ] Add Methods After Inheritance
- [ ] Override Inherited Methods
- [ ] Use a Mixin to Add Common Behavior Between Unrelated Objects
- [ ] Use Closure to Protect Properties Within an Object from Being Modified Externally
- [ ] Understand the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
- [ ] Use an IIFE to Create a Module

### Functional Programming

Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.

In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter().
